Done:
- Fixed a bug where the models would disappear if physics were enabled
- Fixed a bug where velocity would become infinite if no force was applied

Plan of action to make program more secure, expandable and readable:
- Research importing objects from blender.
- Implement smart pointers to manage memory.
- Implement multithreading for collission detection.
- Add a way to add collide boxes to objects.
- Critically look at the abstractions made in the code and see if they can be improved.

Todo:
- Fix the bug where models disappear if Init is called before add model
- Add a way to add models where the mouse is clicked

Done:
- Fixed the bug where models disappear if Init is called before add model
- Implemented a way to add models after the buffers were created

[11/02/2024]
Done:
- Added a way to pause the simulation
- Added a way to add models where the mouse is clicked
- Fixed a bug where it would misplace the models if the window was resized
- Fixed a bug where a click was registered on the main window if a child window was clicked
- Fixed basic collission with the ground

Todo:
- Add a Collider and Translate clas to the engine
- Revamp the code to make use of pointers more and check the performance impact of that
- Add collission detection between models
