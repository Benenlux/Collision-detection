Done:
- Fixed a bug where the models would disappear if physics were enabled
- Fixed a bug where velocity would become infinite if no force was applied

Todo:
- Turn Createcube function into a constructor for the model class, since each instance only holds one model anyway
- Make it so that pointers to the model class are stored instead of the class itself
- Check framerate and optimize if necessary
