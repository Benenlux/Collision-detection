Collision detectiom with OpenGL


Hi there! This is a little program made in c++ using OpenGL that simulates basic collision detection.
It's a project I did on the side to get me started with graphics and get familiar with OpenGL.
It's my first time making a large(r) application in c++ and my first time using OpenGL. If anyone reading this has any tips or tricks please feel free to let me know!
