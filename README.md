# Collision detection with OpenGL


Hi there! This is a little program made in c++ using OpenGL that simulates basic collision detection.
It's a project I did on the side to get me started with graphics and get familiar with OpenGL.
It's my first time making a large(r) application in C++ and my first time using OpenGL. If anyone reading this has any tips or tricks please feel free to let me know!

The dependancies were managed with `vcpkg` and I made use of the following dependancies:
  
  - `[glfw3]`		
 
  Used for window creation.
  
  - `[Glad]`
  
  Used to expose OpenGL functions.
  
  - `[imgui]` 
  
      -`[docking-experimental]`
    
      -`[glfw-binding]`
    
      -`[opengl3-binding]`
    
  Used for GUI and input handling.
  
  - `[glm]`
 
  Used for the math operations.

  Cmake was used to build and run this application
