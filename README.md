# Collision detection with OpenGL


Hi there! This is a little program made in c++ using OpenGL that simulates basic collision detection.
It's a project I did on the side to get me started with graphics and get familiar with OpenGL.
It's my first time making a large(r) application in C++ and my first time using OpenGL. If anyone reading this has any tips or tricks please feel free to let me know!

If you want to check out the application you can simply download the demo folder and run `app.exe`.

The dependancies were managed with `vcpkg` and I made use of the following dependancies:
  
  - `[glfw3]`		
 
  Used for window creation.
  
  - `[Glad]`
  
  Used to expose OpenGL functions.
  
  - `[imgui]` 
  
      -`[docking-experimental]`
    
      -`[glfw-binding]`
    
      -`[opengl3-binding]`
    
  Used for GUI and input handling.
  
  - `[glm]`
 
  Used for the math operations.

  Cmake was used to build and run this application.
